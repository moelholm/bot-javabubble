Source code for the "Java Bubble" Mastodon bot.

## Local development

Development in 'local development' mode is safe:
- database actions happens on your local environment only
- the toot functionality will by default NOT send anything (also: you'll need a proper access_token for it to ever succeed)

That being said: Follow the next 2 steps to be up and running...

### 1 of 2: Launch dynamodb and initialize it for the app

    npm run tool:dynamodb-local
    npm run tool:dynamodb-init

### 2 of 2: Run app

    npm run start:dev

### Bonus: Browse/edit the database

Browse and/or hack in the (local) db (requires [dynamodb-admin])

    npm run tool:dynamodb-admin

## Create a release

In lack of a proper CI/CD pipeline (for now):

    npm run build:lambda

This results in a zip file - which can then be deployed with CDK using the IaC üëçüèª
